          I'm a Full-Stack developer specialized in JavaScript with experience in usage of technologies such as React/Redux, Sass, NodeJS/Express, Next.js, GatsbyJS, Bootstrap/Tailwind, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and more.

          I love being able to think of a creative idea and making it come to
          life by programming it on the screen. My goal is to use my skills to
          develop functional and appealing web-based applications with a focus
          on great user experience, speed and efficiency.

          Since technology is changing at a rapid rate, I have been keeping
          myself up to date with what is happening with current events and where
          technology will take us 5-10 years down the line. What I really love
          about technology is that it is always changing, and that means that
          there is always an opportunity to learn something new. I love learning
          new programming languages and frameworks, along with design principles
          and applying them.
